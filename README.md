213COSI-153A-1 : Mobile Application Development CPA

The app is developed using react, @react-navigation/native, react-native, @react-navigation/bottom-tabs, 
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage. Details can be found in dependencies in package.json.


Name of the app: Force Calculator
My name is jiafan he. I did my bachelor's degree in civil engineering and I know that calculating single element equivalent joint forcs 
for different types of loads can be complicated and time-consuming. Thus I developed this force calculator app which calculates the 
forces for you based on your input. And users are allowed to store the history of outputs if they want.

Screenshots can be found in Image/Screenshots.
